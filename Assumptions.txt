As project task provided were general. I have made several following assumptions

1. Products Data are also uploaded via a secondary API (not stated in the requirement) -> Thus, API was created to simulate this process
2. Products Data are stored in some sort of database -> Thus, using h2 db to simulate database and using flyway to help create table
3. Cache like Redis is available -> Thus, simulated this using concurrentHashMap in productService
4. Validation should not be restricted to only Trade Date. Product Id (BigInteger), Price (BigDecimal) should also be validated and rows be dropped if any of them were found invalid.
